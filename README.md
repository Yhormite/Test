Topic: Predicting CO2 emissions using Regression Analysis.

Background of Topic: Transportation, particularly the emissions from passenger cars, is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on reducing CO2 emissions from vehicles. Analyzing and predicting CO2 emissions from new cars based on their properties can provide valuable insights for policymakers, manufacturers, and consumers.

Aim: Aim is to help establish a model that quantitatively predicts CO2 emissions for new cars based on their varying properties.

Data to use: Data can be found at; CO2 emissions from new passenger cars
